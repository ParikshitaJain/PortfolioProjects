## Project Overview
Airline customer experience plays a crucial role in brand reputation, loyalty, and overall business success. This report analyzes British Airways customer reviews, focusing on key service aspects such as Seat Comfort, Cabin Staff Service, Food & Beverages, Inflight Entertainment, Ground Service, Value for Money, and Wifi & Connectivity. By extracting and cleaning data from Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) and applying sentiment analysis, text processing, and visualization techniques, this study aims to uncover customer perceptions and trends over time. Using natural language processing (NLP) and statistical modeling, the analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, providing valuable insights into enhancing the passenger experience. The findings serve as a foundation for data-driven recommendations that can help British Airways improve customer satisfaction and stay competitive in the airline industry.
