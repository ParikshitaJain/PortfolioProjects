## Project Overview
Data analysis is crucial for the healthcare industry as it directly influences decision-making, operational efficiency, and patient care quality. With the growing amount of patient data being generated, healthcare organizations are increasingly relying on data-driven insights to improve clinical outcomes, streamline operations, and reduce costs.
The Hospital Patient Analysis project focuses on extracting valuable insights from healthcare data to improve patient care, resource allocation, and overall operational efficiency. In this analysis, I used Power BI to visualize and explore data from three core tablesâ€”Encounters, Patients, and Procedures. This powerful tool helped in creating interactive dashboards that provided a comprehensive overview of patient health patterns, their interactions with the healthcare system, and the medical procedures they undergo.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [MavenAnalytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=1&pageSize=5). This data is on ~1k patients of Massachussets General Hospital from 2011-2022, including information on patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters & procedures.

## Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Interactive dashboard for data interpretation and visualization

## Objectives

![Hospital Patients Analysis Model View](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dec255f-d844-4b51-93d1-b9e0e599f8bf)


1. Patient & Demographics Insights:
The first objective of this analysis is to understand the trends in patient visits over the past few years, identifying whether there is a rise in the number of visits, and if so, whether these are from repeat or new patients. A key focus is to examine the demographic factors, such as age and gender, that influence patient volume and whether certain groups require more frequent care. I will explore how patient encounters vary across different age groups and genders to identify potential patterns or trends. Additionally, I aim to analyze whether some patient groups undergo more medical procedures than others, which may reflect a higher need for medical interventions within certain demographics.

2. Operational Efficiency & Healthcare Utilization:
In this section, I aim to investigate whether there has been an increase in the average number of encounters per patient, which could suggest a shift in patient health conditions or healthcare needs. I will also examine the typical duration of a patient encounter and analyze whether this duration is changing over time, potentially reflecting more complex conditions or treatments. Another critical aspect is identifying peak times or seasons when patient visits increase significantly, helping hospital administrators plan for higher demand.

3. Clinical & Treatment Effectiveness:
This objective focuses on evaluating the clinical effectiveness of treatments and procedures performed during patient encounters. I will analyze the most frequently performed procedures, assessing whether their frequency is increasing over time.

4. Financial & Insurance Considerations:
Understanding the financial aspects of patient encounters is crucial for any healthcare organization. In this section, I will analyze how many patient encounters are fully covered by insurance versus those paid out-of-pocket, providing insights into the financial burden on patients.

## Key Findings

- Types of Artworks Displayed: Paintings are the most commonly displayed artworks, followed by photography and sculptures.
- Acquisition Trends: Significant spikes in acquisitions occurred in the late 1960s and early 2000s, likely due to major donations or museum expansion efforts.
- Artist Representation: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is the most featured artist, with notable contributions from Picasso, Matisse, and others.
- Common Artwork Types: Print and photographs dominate the collection, followed by illustrated books and drawings.
- Artist Nationality: The majority of artists represented are American, followed by French, German, and British artists.

## Conclusion

The MoMA art collection analysis reveals significant trends in acquisitions, artist representation, and artwork types. The findings suggest that paintings, prints, and photographs dominate the collection, with a strong focus on American and European artists. Acquisition patterns highlight key periods of growth, which may inform future collection strategies. Recommendations include diversifying artist representation, improving data completeness, and leveraging insights for better exhibition planning. By continuously analyzing and updating the collection data, MoMA can enhance its curation and provide a more inclusive and engaging experience for visitors.
