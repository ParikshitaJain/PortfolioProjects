## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [MavenAnalytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=1&pageSize=5). This research dataset contains 157,630 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMAâ€™s collection and cataloged in their database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum.
